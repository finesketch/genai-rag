This means that RAG can leverage all available data to provide more relevant and context-aware responses, making it particularly useful for organizations with extensive internal data resources.\\n\\nIn contrast, fine-tuning involves adjusting the model's weights and biases based on new training data, which permanently changes how the model interacts with new inputs. Fine-tuning is more suitable for teaching the model specialized tasks or adapting it to a specific domain. However, it comes with limitations, such as context window sizes and the risk of overfitting on a specific dataset.\\n\\nIn summary, RAG focuses on utilizing external data dynamically, while fine-tuning modifies the model itself for specific tasks or domains.\""
